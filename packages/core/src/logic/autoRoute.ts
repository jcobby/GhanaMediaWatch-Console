/**
 * Automatic routing — which businesses receive a submission.
 *
 * Reports reach businesses on their own. A reporter picks a category and,
 * optionally, names organisations; everything else is matching. Requiring a
 * human to touch every submission does not survive contact with volume — a few
 * hundred reports a day would put the whole platform behind one desk.
 *
 * The platform operator's desk sits *above* this: they see every submission and
 * what it was auto-routed to, and can add or remove recipients. Oversight and
 * override, not a gate.
 *
 * Pure and testable — routing decides who gets paid and who gets the footage,
 * which is not logic to leave unverified.
